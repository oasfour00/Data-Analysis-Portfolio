Hello!

Thank you for taking the time for checking out my portfolio! This is a work in progress, and I am always looking to expand my working knowledge of data analysis and visualization.

In the meantime, here is a quick explanation of what you can hope to see in each of these files.

DATA ANALYSIS PORTFOLIO PROJECT

This file is an exploratory Data Analytics project in Python using multiple statistical plotting techniques. It includes the use of the Pandas and Numpy libraries for data cleanup, and the Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries for visualization. The data vlisualization was done on a database of failed banks. I walk through my thought process as I go along using comments in the code.

Smoking Research Paper

This is a research paper I had written which exmplores the relationship between a countries smoking population and it's national net income. I state my hypothesis, explain my data, data collection methods, and then state my conclusion based on the evidence gathered. This evidence is in the form of scatterplots and spreadsheets created from information from the WorldBank Database.
