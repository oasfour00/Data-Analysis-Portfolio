# Data-Analysis-Portfolio
This is an Exploratory Data Analytics project in Python using multiple statistical plotting techniques.
It is in the form of a Jupyter Notebook, however there is also a pdf version available.

The PDF version is easier to consume as there is no setup required, but loses the interactivity of the Jupyter Notebook.
